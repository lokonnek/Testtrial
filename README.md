# The effect of atypical exemplars on the manual response in a categorization task: A replication study

## Welcome
We are glad you found your way to our repository for our partial replication of the original study 'Graded motor responses in the time	course of categorizing atypical exemplars'.
As a part of our course 'Experimental Psychology Lab', offered by Dr. Michael	Franke at the University of Osnabrueck, we performed this experiment. 
The experiment was executed in July 2020.
