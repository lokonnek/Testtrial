# The effect of atypical exemplars on the manual response in a categorization task: A replication study

## Welcome
We are glad you found your way to our repository for our partial replication of the original study 'Graded motor responses in the time	course of categorizing atypical exemplars'.
As a part of our course 'Experimental Psychology Lab', offered by Dr. Michael	Franke at the University of Osnabrueck, we performed this experiment. 
The experiment was executed in July 2020.
Our group consists of Luisa Drescher, Hannah Gauditz, Lilian Menzner und Lilith Okonnek.
Have a look in the wiki for an overwiew of the materials we provide here.

## Original paper
Our study is based upon parts of the study 'Graded motor responses in the time	course of categorizing atypical exemplars'by Dale et. al. and was published in 2007 in 'Memory & Cognition'.
